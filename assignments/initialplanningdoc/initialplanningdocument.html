    <h1>Initial Planning Document</h1>
    <h2>Site Purpose Statement</h2>
    <p>The purpose for this site is simply to give the user a very simple, sophisticated, easy to use website. It is mostly geared towards someone who would want to know the simple things about the weather, such as the high and low for the day, wind, and other noticeable factors. It would not, however, be geared towards someone who wants to plan out their week's activities, as there is no kind of forecasting whatsoever. On a mobile device, it shows you right off the bat everything you would need to know for the day.</p>
    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>The audience with this website could really be anyone. If someone wants to plan out what to wear for the day, to determine whether or not it would be a good day to play outdoor sports, or even to go to the beach, this webiste is for them! I've checked the weather for many occasions and I know many others who similarly check the weather for small things. However, it would be easier to use for an on the go audience, due to the amount of information provided in the page. On a phone or tablet, the information takes up the screen as much as it needs to to provide the simple information. But with the browser window it seemed like there was a lot of extra space. Because there is no forecasting, radar, or road condition pages, this site would not be useful for any kind of planned trips. If you are looking for more detailed information and need to get to the nitty-gritty, then other sites might be a better choice. Due to the planning of the website, it would be easy to use on a computer, on the go with a phone, or even in the comfort of your living room on a tablet. </p>
    <h2>Persona</h2>
    <p>Spencer is a 24 year old atmospheric science major. He is about to start grad school at San Jose State to continue into their master's program. He often plans trips based off of the weather, and has always done so for the family since he was 8. He is an outdoorsman who plans backpacking trips in Idaho every summer, and needs to plan what to bring based off the weather. He always has at least one tab on his browser dedicated to the weather so he can access it anytime he is using his computer. </p>

    <h2>Peer Review</h2>
    <p>Kelton Barr looked over my page. He said that he liked my page and the professional feel it created. He mentioned that I could do better in being more specific in my audience portion. I got more specific in suggesting that this would be geared towards a more mobile audience.</p>
