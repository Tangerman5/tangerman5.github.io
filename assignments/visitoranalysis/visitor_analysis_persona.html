                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The typical person who would go out an buy Cheez-its would most likely be a parent or parents with children, who are in constant need of snack food. Some demographics of the consumer: age between 30-40, middle to low class, and anywhere in the United States. The site itself was very simple, as there weren't many options immediately available. When the menu button was pressed, only 4 options showed: Products, where to buy, promotions, and an about us page. When it comes to anyone coming to the webpage, I feel like most visitors will simply be trying to see what kinds of products are available, since there are no options to purchase them online. The color was appealing, nothing crazy. The site was a simple scroll-down only page, so no unnecessary horizontal scrolling to get the whole picture. </p>

                <h3>Jacky</h3>
                <p>Jacky is a 43 year old mother of 3 boys, aging 13, 15, and 17. When her children are at school she works as a receptionist at the local orthodontist office. She is married and her husband is working job to job trying to make ends meet. She cares very much for her family, and understands her hard financial situation comes from the poor economy in her small town. As long as the bills are paid and food is on the table, she is happy. She likes to provide her children with food they enjoy, and as they are all growing teenage boys, they eat a lot. She mostly buys them healthy snacks, but one she does like to buy them are Cheez-It crackers. They don't tend to like other crackers such as Triscuit or animal crackers, but Cheez-its are one that they can all agree on. "Spence-, Isaa-, Alex! Come here and do the dishes!" </p>

                <h2>Site Contrast</h2>
                <p>One of the sites I visited that I actually enjoy visiting is <a href="https://distrowatch.com">Distrowatch</a>. The website is terrible. There is so much information no real use of white space, nothing but advertisements to catch your eye, and no good use of minimizing the information on the page. The site, in my personal experience with it, knows the audience because it shows you updates on new distrobutions of Linux available to you. So with that in mind, it shows you the new, while you can still find the old ones you liked previously. I feel like both Cheez-Its and Distrowatch knew their audience, but Cheez-Its definitely beats out Distrowatch as far as making the information available to them and directing them easily to where they are trying to go. The mobile site for Distrowatch is also atrocious. The site is definitely meant for a computer or a laptop as they are looking to download entire operating systems. You can't really do that on your phone, hence going to the site on a phone would just be for research. On the phone, the text was too small, unlike the Cheez-It site that blew things up to a good readable size.</p>
